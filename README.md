# Mumla

Mumla is a fork and continuation of [Plumble](https://github.com/acomminos/Plumble),
a robust GPLv3 Mumble client for Android originally written by Andrew Comminos.
It uses the the [Humla](https://gitlab.com/quite/humla) protocol implementation
(forked from Comminos's [Jumble](https://github.com/acomminos/Jumble)).

Mumla should run on Android 4.0 (IceCreamSandwich, API 14) and later.

Mumla is available [on F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/se.lublin.mumla/).

There is a small [landing page](https://mumla-app.gitlab.io/), that also has
information about [Beta releases](https://mumla-app.gitlab.io/beta/).
